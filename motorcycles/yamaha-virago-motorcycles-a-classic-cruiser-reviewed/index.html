<p>
The Yamaha Virago motorcycle has a great little history behind it! As the very first V-twin motorcycle of the cruiser variety produced by the Japanese motorcycle corporations, it was a substantial enough cruiser motorcycle to scare Harley Davidson into requesting that additional taxes be put on any imported motorcycle over 700cc in engine size. This tactic did not stop Yamaha from importing the Virago, however. By the time of the tariff's introduction, Yamaha was producing a 750cc engine and 920cc engine for the Virago. So Yamaha did what most smart corporations do: they attempted to sidestep the issue by lowering the Virago 750cc to a 699cc. This reduced the power of the engine, of course, but kept the price low for riders just joining the cruiser market. Yamaha also increased the power on the 920cc to 1000 (and 1100 eventually) to give the more experienced cruiser rider a little more powerful engine.
</p><p>
Yamaha produced the Virago between 1982 and 1999, at which time it was phased into the V-Star, Road Star, and Drag Star model names. During the manufacturing period, there were other engine sizes produced besides the 700, 750, 920, 1000, and 1100cc engines, but the Virago 1100 (also know as the Virago XV1100) was by far the most popular of the motorcycles in the United States. This popularity was probably helped along by the production of the VX1100 being based out of Georgia.
</p>
<p>
Yamaha did produce a 125cc sized engine shortly after beginning the motorcycle's run, but it was quickly phased out. The Virago XV250 became the defacto motorcycle for those just beginning to ride in the Cruiser class. In fact, the XV250 was so popular that the 250 made a brief comeback in 2007 before being rebadged as the V-Star 250 in 2008.
</p><p>

The Yamaha Virago XV400 was also put into production sometime after the 250cc, but very few models were manufactured. True Virago collectors are always searching for an XV400 to put into the For a true "hard to find" motorcycle, a collector of Yamaha Virago motorcycles will want to add the XV400 to their collection due to the limited number available.
</p>
<p>
Purchasing a new Yamaha Virago motorcycle is out of the question since the manufacturing run has completed, but a quick check of eBay confirms that a used Yamaha Virago can be purchased for as low as $300 for a mid to late 1980's XV700 and as high as $3,000 for a completely restored 1983 XV750 edition.
