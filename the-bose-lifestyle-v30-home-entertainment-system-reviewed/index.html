                        <h4><a href="#">The Bose Lifestyle V30 Home Entertainment System Reviewed</a>
                        </h4>
<p>
As with the other Bose Lifestyle systems we have reviewed, the Bose Lifestyle V30 Home Entertainment System is fairly expensive. And if expense or cost is a major factor, then a Bose product probably isn't going to be your first choice, but instead maybe you'll go for a 'Theater in a box' from Wal-mart. And that's perfectly fine! But for audiophiles, the Bose V30 LifeStyle is one of the high-end home entertainment systems that you'll want to check into before making a purchase. The Bose v30 Lifestyle is a Bose quality product, meaning that it offers that excellent sound you expect from Bose. But since it's an entertainment system, it also offers several other features (like on-screen guided setup and room calibration), along with one of the easiest systems to install you can find.
</p>
<p>
The entire Bose Lifestyle v30 home entertainment system is built around the Bose specific Adaptiq system. Adaptiq is the technology that allows the system to determine the setup for the best audio performance in your particular environment. We all know that very few rooms are the same, and Bose understands that as well. So with the on-screen setup, you can setup the Bose v30 Lifestyle to determine your room's acoustic, and find the best range for your speakers to perform.
</p>
<p>
One of the more important parts of calibrating a system are the speakers, and the Bose Lifestyle v30 home entertainment system has you covered. Bose includes an Acoustimass module which basically serves as a sort of subwoofer with deeper sounds coming through the Acoustimass. A center speaker is included to center the sound, but the real jewel of the speakers are in the 4 Jewel cube speakers. These speakers are actually two speakers in one which can be swiveled during calibration to increase the range of the surround sound of the Bose v30 system. They are fairly small speakers, but the sound and range provided is more than you could expect from the aforementioned 'theater in a box' systems.
</p>
<p>
Bose makes it very easy to enjoy your entertainment through the Bose v30 Lifestyle. With one touch buttons, you can select the input you want to view or listen to through the Bose, whether it's a DVD, cable, radio, or CD. With DVD or other none-HD video, the Bose v30 Lifestyle system automatically up-converts the video to 1080p as it's processed through the system, giving you the best possible video for your movies or television entertainment. Just connect the device to the Bose through the HDMI input, and up-conversion automatically transforms to 1080p HD viewing.
</p><p>
As with all Bose products, clean lines and hidden panels keep the Bose v30 Lifestyle home entertainment system looking finished and stylish. You can plug some devices into the front of the v30 if you want for ease of use, and the panels allow you to keep a clean finish with hidden cables. But for devices that will always be connected, the Bose v30 Lifestyle system allows for many devices to stay plugged in to the rear device through a myriad of A/V, Component, HDMI, and USB inputs.
</p><p>
And finally, it's easy to connect the Bose v30 Lifestyle system to any room with the Bose Link products. Use Bose Link to listen to your music all around your house and home, from multiple sources (at the Bose v30 system) if you so choose.
